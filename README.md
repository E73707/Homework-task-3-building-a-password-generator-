# Homework task 3 building a password generator 
Building a password generator

Below is a Link and an image to my homework task 3, This Task required myself to build a password generating web application which would accept user input involving the password length, capital letters, special characters and numerical values. This was my first project using JavaScript and was my most enjoyable project to date!

Within the script I utilised Functions and other JavaScript methods that I had learned in class, as well as methods that i had researched on my own, and aimed at building the cleanest and most readable code that I am currently capable of.
